			<h4>About Me:</h4>
			<p>
		 		I have always been interested in science and technology, as can been seen from this high quality video from my high school days.
			</p>

			<!-- Link to a youtube video I made -->

				Look at those LEDs go!
			</p>

			<p>
				I went on to study mechanical engineering and then mixed things up and did a brief detour into the world of finance.  In both courses of study, I enjoyed learning how to program.  I learned how to model fluid flows and price financial assets all using MATLAB.
			</p>

			<p>
				I then entered the professional world, but there was always a part of me that wanted to learn more about programming and computer science.  I took courses on Coursera and EdX, and played around on <a href="https://freecodecamp.org"> freecodecamp</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I knew I wanted to get a formal education in computer science and in January 2020, I started a <a href="https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc">post-baccalaureate program through Oregon State University.</a>  I am around a third of the way through the program, and am excited to start working as a software engineer.
			</p>

			<p>
				For anyone interested in seeing if computer science is for them, I highly recommend the resources in the box to the right.
